Description: 
        MapResources - A Whois Resource Discovery Tool.
        ===============================================
        
        This package enables one to discover network resources in ARIN's Whois
        database that may belong to an organization. A starting point in
        the form of a known POC handle, organization handle, net handle or ASN
        number is assumed. The tool thereafter queries ARIN's RESTful API in
        order to find other resources that the organization may hold.
        
        The main driver utility program for this package is
        map_resources.map_whois.py. The -h option to this script provides more
        information on the different options that are available to the user.
        
        Note that even though most interfaces in the map_resources module are
        marked as public, they are still in flux and subject to change.
